# Guide-me
An Application uses to guide blind people to walk in places like hospital by providing a map of the place and with a dijkstra algorithm it finds the best root to reach his destination which is provided by his voice 


First provide the name of the location by the voice  (it convert speech to text using speech_recognition library)

Then with the privided map the Ai start telling the direction to the blind and keep tracking him with GPS 

And using dijkstra algorithm it find the best root to walk on

And also it can detect text in sign and convert it to sound using pytesseract and gtts(Google Text-to-Speech)

A simple imagination of the idea
